# hookR-fb-lottery
Create a quick lottery between commentors on a facebook post, powered by hookR.

## Planned
The plan is to make a very simple lottery application that works by hooking into facebook via [hookR](https://github.com/dennisdegryse/ddj-hookr/).

A couple of planned features are:
- One chance per facebook account
- Exclude original poster of thread.
- Button to (re)roll.
- Fetch random numbers from random.org.
